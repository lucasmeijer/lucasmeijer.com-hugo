I joined [Unity](https://unity3d.com) in 2009. We've grown it from ~50 to 1.5 million monthly active users. From 15 to 3000+ employees.  From a living room to a [public company](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/U?p=U&.tsrc=fin-srch).

Iâ€™ve enjoyed wearing many hats over the years. Last minute runs to kinkos. Running all engineering. Presenting the work of our dev teams at our unite conferences. And now focusing on technical direction.
